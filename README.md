# Word-Phoneme-App

This is the Word Phoneme App. It breaks down words into their phonemes for users to sound out and learn how to say.

# Problem:
Pronounciation of words in the English language is quite difficult for non-native speakers. I faced this struggle myself immigration from India.
To ensure a smooth experience and fast learning of the English language, I coded this app.

# Solution:
When the user enters a word in the search bar, the program finds the word in the local dictionary and then breaks it down into individual phoneme buttons.
Users can click these buttons to hear how the phonemes are sounded out, and be able to pronounce the words better. Users can practice individual phonemes and play games on the other screens of the app.

# Impact:
I hope to help non-English speakers, willing to learn the language, pronounce words more accurately and streamline their learning journey.

# Setup and Usage:
As I do not have an Apple account, this app is only compatible with Android devices. To run the app, download the APK, and run it. Thanks!
